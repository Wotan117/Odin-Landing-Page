The purpose of this exersice is to get to know the flexbox funktion of CSS as well as to dable a bit into itnerface creation. As a resource I use the Oding Project as well as information aviable online.


My Approach to this interface is to creat a structure seperated in four quaters (top, secon, third, last) and seperated them each akording to the needs. then adjust adjuste the CSS flexbox settings.
Following this is wil reavauate my porgress, define what has to be adjusted  and change it. This step is repeated until the desiered Outcome is achived.

This aproach is inspired by the AGIL structure and I hope to imitated by it to also have a "working" Prototype that get closer and closer to the desiered end product.
